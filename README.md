# React 360 Video Player MVP

This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis.

This was a solo project with the object of rapidly creating and deploying a MVP.
Objectives included practicing autonomous learning by incorporating new technologies.
The idea was to explore [React 360](https://github.com/facebook/react-360) by creating a VR Video player.

See it deployed [here](https://eugenekim000.github.io/React360VideoPlayerMVP/)  ðŸ‘ˆ
